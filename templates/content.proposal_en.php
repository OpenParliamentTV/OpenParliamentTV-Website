						<p>In many countries, democratic institutions are increasingly questioned and sometimes openly attacked by parts of society. </p>
						<p>With Open Parliament TV we build up trust in parliamentary democracy, by making political decision processes more transparent, trustworthy and participatory.</p>
						<p>We contribute to a democracy, in which </p>
						<ul>
							<li>the full spectrum of political opinions and decisions becomes visible </li>
							<li>we learn to value diversity in our society </li>
							<li>we learn to engage in dialogue across political and societal levels and </li>
							<li>we increase civic political participation. </li>
						</ul>
						<p>This is how we can strengthen social cohesion and form vivid, fortified democracies, driven by strong civil societies.</p>

						<h3 style="color: #79a9b9;">Mission</h3>
						<p>We stand up for our vision of thrustworthy and credible parliamentary democracies on all political levels (municipal, regional, national and international) by increasing the <strong>transparency</strong> of political work, encouraging political <strong>education</strong> in civil society and strengthening civic <strong>participation</strong> in political processes. Facilitating the <strong>digitisation</strong> of political institutions, workflows and structures is hereby essential for our mission. </p>
						<p><strong><u>Transparency:</u></strong> We make political work visible. Political discourse, debates, decision processes and the formation process of laws have to be transparent and comprehensible on regional, national and international levels. We thus advocate for open interfaces to allow citizens unrestricted access to parliamentary data. </p>
						<p><strong><u>Education:</u></strong> We support political education by conveying parliamentary debates, offer background information, interconnect political discourse and debates and uncover misinformation. We help political institutions to build up the knowledge necessary for digitising existing structures.</p>
						<p><strong><u>Participation</u></strong><u>:</u> We create means of participation for civil society. By breaking open existing structures, facilitating new networks and making data usable, we help citizens to engage, discuss and take part in politics. We pay close attention to accessible design and implementation of all means of participation. </p>

					<div class="card-body">
						<h3 style="color: #76b88a;">Strategy</h3>
						<p>To implement our vision of thrustworthy and credible parliamentary democracies through more transparency, education and participation, we focus on three closely connected strategical areas: <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>policy/ advocacy</strong>, <strong>network</strong>.</p>
						<p><strong><u>Technology:</u></strong></p><p>Almost every parliament publishes video recordings and text proceedings of sessions. Together with other documents like legislative proposals, motions or inquiries, they allow direct insight into the decision processes of parliamentary democracy.</p>
						<p>But despite comparable structures and similar workflows, parliamentary proceedings are published in various, incompatible formats and parliament tv contents are only accessible via proprietary platforms. </p>
						<p>Videos recordings of parliamentary debates hold great untapped potential for digital democracy. They are more tangible than text documents or lists of votes and provide an easily accessible “window“ to the underlying discussions, negotiations and decisions. </p>
						<p>We want to use this potential by </p>
						<ul>
							<li>creating a joint technological basis for parliaments (interoperable standards, interfaces and document formats) as well as </li>
							<li>developing a search engine and interactive video platform, in which speeches are searchable, linkable, citable and sharable via a synchronisation of videos and proceedings. </li>
						</ul>
						<p>To enable more participation and dialogue, we create technical interfaces to existing civic democracy projects and allow journalists to connect parliamentary debates with background information, original sources or fact checks. </p>
						<p>All components will be published under open licenses and are optimised for decentral implementation. New parliaments can either be integrated into existing Open Parliament TV platforms or established independently. Via open data interfaces, all contents are still accessible, searchable and linkable beyond the boundaries of single parliaments. </p>
						<p><strong><u>Policy / Advocacy:</u></strong></p>
						<p>In many countries the digitisation of parliamentary workflows is hampered by a lack of resources, missing legal frameworks, outsourced know-how and outdated IT- and consulting structures. Additionally, political bodies and public administrations often have a limited understanding for the necessity as well as the structures for interparliamentary coordination and collaboration. </p>
						<p>The development of legal frameworks, the application of technological standards or the implementation of open data strategies is however not decided on administrative levels. </p>
						<p>This is why we advocate on all political levels for </p>
						<ul>
							<li>a legal right to Linked Open Data, </li>
							<li>open licencing of all parliamentary contents and data, </li>
							<li>access to and open licensing of all publicly funded software components (free and open source), </li>
							<li>compliance with and improvement of existing standards for technical interfaces, videos, documents and respective metadata, </li>
							<li>internal competence building for the systematic application of Linked Open Data principles, </li>
							<li>the publication and long-term archival of video recordings of parliamentary debates (where that is not yet the case), hearings and committee meetings as well as </li>
							<li>permanent public funding and operation of the required infrastructure and processes. </li>
						</ul>
						<p>We work hard to convince decision-makers, parliamentary groups and the bureaus of parliament to place these goals sustainably on the political agenda. </p>
						<p>We actively engage in Open Government work and join existing international coalitions, associations, networks and communities. We stand up for our vision and mission in working groups, committees and at public events, and raise awareness for the direct connection of transparent political processes and trustworthy, credible parliamentary democracies. </p>
						<p><strong><u>Network:</u></strong></p>
						<p>To effectively interlink political debates beyond parliamentary boundaries, we build up our own network, in which we focus specifically on the use of parliamentary data and video recordings from parliamentary debates. </p>
						<p>We create communication channels and regular discussion forums between </p>
						<ul>
							<li>linguists, social-, information- and political scientists, </li>
							<li>parliamentary administrations, </li>
							<li>journalists and news labs, </li>
							<li>Parliamentary Monitoring Organisations (PMOs) and </li>
							<li>open data activists </li>
						</ul>
						<p>who already work on document formats and standardised parliamentary data interfaces for many years in their respective organisations and communities.  </p>
						<p>As a network we advocate for creating interparliamentary collaboration structures and make sure that the different juristictions, languages, parliamentary systems and technological conditions are considered when implementing international standards. </p>
						<p>We actively support transnational and interdisciplinary knowledge transfer, facilitate a joint knowledge base and build up respective ressources.</p>

								<p class="mt-3">To integrate participatory democratic processes better into our digitised daily life, they need to be easily, promptly and directly accessible for everyone. </p>
								<p>Videos of parliamentary debates serve as a tangible and contemporary interface to the daily work of parliaments. The recordings and livestreams are not just video collections for journalists or members of parliament but a direct application of the guiding principle “the parliament negotiates in public“. </p>
								<p>With Open Parliament TV, we want to strengthen Digital Democracy by </p>
								<ul>
									<li>making parliamentary processes more transparent and accessible </li>
									<li>embedding political education in the context of current political debates in parliament </li>
									<li>interlinking parliamentary debates with social discourse </li>
								</ul>
								<p>We will  </p>
								<ul>
									<li>make video recordings of speeches searchable word by word beyond the boundaries of single parliaments </li>
									<li>allow citing, embedding, sharing and commenting custom video segments within the context of the full speech </li>
									<li>enrich speeches with background information on people, parties, factions, votes and the formation process of laws </li>
									<li>automatically link relevant terms with additional information like explanatory videos, original documents or encyclopedic knowledge </li>
									<li>develop tools and didactic concepts for the manual annotation / linking of speeches with teaching and learning resources </li>
									<li>connect existing civic democracy projects and tools via open APIs with the Open Parliament TV platform </li>
								</ul>
								<strong><u>Target Groups</u></strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Politically interested citizens who critically engage with parliamentary developments </li>
									<li>Citizens who are not yet engaged in parliamentary debates because of their bad accessibility </li>

								<p class="mt-3">Parliamentary debates are a regular topic in news, on social media or in talk shows. In their function as “fourth estate“, journalists interpret developments in parliaments, critically analyse and discuss political standpoints and contextualise statements of politicians. </p>
								<p>But the way videos of speeches in parliament are currently published is largely based upon sharing short key moments, with a clear lack of contextual information like a link to the full debate, relevant original documents or additional materials. This means video clips are used to share short moments, but as soon as the speeches are used for in-depth analyses, background articles, fact checks or longform reporting, the basis are the textual proceedings. Because the videos are neither searchable by keywords nor can specific statements be cited or directly interlinked. </p>
								<p>We want to improve the usability of videos of parliamentary debates for journalistic purposes by </p>
								<ul>
									<li>simplifying the finding, sharing, embedding and citation of specific video segments </li>
									<li>allowing to embed up-to-date news coverage into speeches </li>
									<li>providing tools for statistical evaluation and analysis of parliamentary debates </li>
								</ul>
								<p>We will </p>
								<ul>
									<li>improve and extend the citation features on the Open Parliament TV platform </li>
									<li>develop tools which allow embedding and linking current news coverage in collaboration with media partners </li>
									<li>develop custom interfaces for editorial systems and journalistic workflows </li>
									<li>create a sustainable long-term technical infrastructure </li>
									<li>publish evaluations and analysis of debates together with data journalists </li>
									<li>create new formats and means of access for parliament tv in collaboration with news labs and innovation departments of public broadcasters </li>
								</ul>
								<strong><u>Target Groups</u></strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Data journalists, political editors, news editors </li>
									<li>News labs and innovation departments of public broadcasters </li>
