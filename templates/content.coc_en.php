						<h3>Purpose</h3>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="card-body">
							<p>Our Code of Conduct is intended to be a guide for Open Parliament TV and therefore applies equally to all of us. It is addressed to everyone from management and employees to contractors and collaborators. </p>
							<p>These rules of conduct are intended to provide orientation for working together on an equal footing by mutual agreement. The Code of Conduct is based on common values and rules of cooperation.  </p>

						<h3>Who we are</h3>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="card-body">
							<p>We are Open Parliament TV. We want to build up trust in parliamentary democracy, by making political decision processes more transparent, trustworthy and participatory. We want to strengthen social cohesion and form a vivid, fortified democracy, driven by a strong civil society. </p>
							<p>We create a space where the full spectrum of political opinions and decisions becomes visible. We learn to value and protect diversity in our society, to engage in dialogue across political and societal levels, and contribute to increasing civic political participation. </p>

						<h3>Our Values</h3>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="card-body">
							<p>As Open Parliament TV we value openness, participation and transparency. We believe that the access to knowledge, digital literacy and public scrutiny contribute to the democratisation of society. </p>
							<blockquote>”Fail productively, grow constructively, share collectively.”</blockquote>
							<p>In order to adapt to a constantly evolving society, we listen whenever we learn something new. We gratefully accept feedback to gain new perspectives. We do not believe in gatekeeping: sharing our skills and knowledge means multiplying them. </p>
							<p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging team members to recognise and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on all of us. </p>
							<p>Sustainable, environmentally conscious action is a matter of concern to us; even if it is not within our field of action. We take care to save resources wherever we can. </p>

							<p>A conscious and targeted approach to diversity helps to prevent discrimination and promote, as well as create equal opportunities. </p>
							<p>At Open Parliament TV, we want people to be able to participate and feel comfortable regardless of gender, sexual orientation, origin, faith, appearance, religion or age. We do not tolerate sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory behaviour. </p>
							<p>We work together cooperatively and try to anticipate and avoid or cooperatively resolve conflicts that may arise when people work together. Discrimination can also occur unintentionally or unconsciously. For this reason, we take perceived discrimination seriously and deal openly, appropriately and self-critically with statements or behaviour that are perceived as discriminatory. This also includes non-verbal forms of discrimination, such as cultural appropriation. </p>
							<p>Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being. We acknowledge that not everybody is always in their best state and collectively agree that our physical and mental health are more important than our work on Open Parliament TV. </p>

								<li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech. </li>
								<li>Be mindful of your surroundings and the people you work with. Alert the awareness person if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential. </li>

						<h3>Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour</h3>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div class="card-body">
							<p>Unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately. </p>
							<p>If somebody engages in unacceptable behaviour, the responsible person (project lead or event organisers) may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the team and community without warning. </p>
							<h3>Conflict management</h3>
							<p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify the awareness person as soon as possible. It is everyone's responsibility to address problems early so that we can solve them together. In doing so, we do not make decisions for others, and we do not put anyone under pressure, but help to find a solution amicably for the benefit of the conflict parties and Open Parliament TV.  </p>
							<p>If not possible in a direct way, we try to solve conflicts in cooperation with a mediator. Tell the awareness person, so they can make an appointment with a mediator. </p>

					<div>
						<div class="card-body">
							<p>As an organisation promoting democracy, it is important for us to reflect the diversity of the political landscape. Freedom of expression is one of the most important pillars of a democratic society. Freedom of expression begins with political freedom and equality under the law and ends where the fundamental human rights of individual people or groups are violated. </p>
							<p>For this reason, we refuse to work with parties, organisations and people who engage in discriminatory behaviour, undermine democratic values and institutions, or actively engage against our vision, mission and strategy. </p>
